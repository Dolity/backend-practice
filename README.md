Backend Roadmap Mini Projects
=============================

This repository contains a collection of backend mini projects that follow the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) Backend Developer roadmap.

The main goal of this repo is to practice and improve backend development skills using **Node.js** and **Express.js** as the primary stack.

## What You Will Find Here

- **Small, focused backend projects** (e.g. task trackers, simple APIs).
- **Express.js-based applications** for hands-on practice.
- Use of **JSON files** or simple data stores in early projects to focus on backend logic first.

Each project lives in its own subfolder (for example, `task-tracker/`) and usually includes:

- A small Node.js/Express.js application.
- A dedicated `README.md` describing that specific project.

## Tech Stack (Overall)

- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js (for most projects)
- **Other tools**: Built-in Node.js modules, JSON files, and other simple storage mechanisms for practice.

## Purpose

This repository is intended as a learning playground to:

- Practice building backend APIs and CLI tools.
- Get comfortable with Express.js and Node.js.
- Experiment with small features like CRUD operations, routing, and basic data handling.

## Projects

Below is an overview of the mini projects organized as separate folders in this repository:

- **task-tracker/**  
  A simple CLI-based task tracker. Tasks are stored in a `task.json` file and can be created, listed, updated, deleted, and marked with different statuses.  
  Reference: https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker

- **github-user-activity/**  
  A project (planned/under development) to fetch and display GitHub user activity, useful for practicing calling external APIs and handling JSON responses.  
  Reference: https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity

- **expense-tracker/**  
  Expense tracking app (non-API version) to manage personal expenses, focusing on basic data modeling and CRUD.  
  Reference: https://roadmap.sh/projects/expense-tracker

- **number-guessing-game/**  
  A small console game to guess a number. Useful for getting comfortable with Node.js I/O and control flow.  
  Reference: https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game

  A note-taking tool that works with Markdown files. Good for practicing file I/O and basic content organization.  
  Reference: https://roadmap.sh/projects/markdown-note-taking-app

- **url-shortening-service/**  
  Backend for generating and resolving short URLs, focusing on routing, persistent storage, and redirect logic.  
  Reference: https://roadmap.sh/projects/url-shortening-service

- **broadcast-server/**  
  A server for broadcasting messages to multiple clients (planned). Useful for practicing real-time patterns.  
  Reference: https://roadmap.sh/projects/broadcast-server

- **caching-proxy/**  
  A proxy server with caching behavior (planned), focusing on performance, caching strategies, and middleware.  
  Reference: https://roadmap.sh/projects/caching-proxy

- **database-backup-utility/**  
  A utility service for backing up databases or data files. Good practice for scheduled jobs and file management.  
  Reference: https://roadmap.sh/projects/database-backup-utility

- **tmdb-cli-tool/**  
  CLI tool (planned) to interact with The Movie Database (TMDb) API, useful for practicing external API integration.  
  Reference: https://roadmap.sh/projects/tmdb-cli-tool
