# Backend Practice

A personal learning repository for exploring backend development across multiple programming languages.

The goal is to understand each language's **syntax**, **idioms**, **lifecycle**, and backend patterns by building syntax exercises and CRUD projects in each one.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn and compare syntax across different backend languages.
- Build CRUD applications to understand request/response lifecycle, routing, and data handling in each language.
- Get hands-on experience with each language's ecosystem, tooling, and frameworks.

## Repository Structure

```
backend-practice/
├── node/           # Node.js (Express.js, NestJS, Elysia)
├── golang/         # Go
├── rust/           # Rust
├── c#/             # C# (.NET)
└── java/           # Java (Spring Boot)
```

Each language folder contains:
- **Syntax exercises** — small programs covering language fundamentals.
- **CRUD project(s)** — a REST API or application demonstrating the full create/read/update/delete lifecycle.
- A dedicated `README.md` with setup instructions and notes.

## Languages & Frameworks

| Language | Framework / Runtime | Folder |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| JavaScript / TypeScript | Node.js, Express.js, NestJS, Elysia | `node/` |
| Go | Standard library / Gin / Fiber | `golang/` |
| Rust | Actix-web / Axum | `rust/` |
| C# | ASP.NET Core | `c#/` |
| Java | Spring Boot | `java/` |

## What Each Section Covers

- **Syntax** — variables, types, control flow, functions, structs/classes, error handling, concurrency basics.
- **CRUD Lifecycle** — HTTP routing, request parsing, response formatting, middleware, database interaction.
- **Tooling** — package managers, build tools, project structure conventions for each ecosystem.

## Reference

Projects are inspired by [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) backend project ideas.
